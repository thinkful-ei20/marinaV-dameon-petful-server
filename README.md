Petful
============================

A collaborative full stack project developed by [Marina Valiquette](https://github.com/Sakela17) 
and [Dameon Mendoza](https://github.com/Dameon1).
The goal was to create a site for an animal shelter which allows adoption of cats and dogs. 
These are the only two animals allowed in the shelter. The adoption process works strictly 
on a first-in, first-out basis. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt 
the animals that have been in the shelter the longest.
